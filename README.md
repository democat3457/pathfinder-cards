This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Who is this for

Are you running TTRPG, especially Pathfinder? Have you ever run a mage and wanted to print out spells, or wanted to print your monsters as GM? Then this is good place for you - and for me :). 
What this app allows you is to write, save, edit and print your own TTRPG cards.

## How does it work

Basically you just create a new project (set of cards, you can have multiple and switch them around), click on Create card, fill in fields that give sense to you, save card.
When you are ready to print you cards, just Display project, and use printing interface of your browser (usually Ctrl+P).

## How can I run the app on my computer

Download the code through GitHub interface. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). In the ccde directory, run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser use the app.
